
Git and GitHub Workflow Exercise

1. Project Initialization:

   Steps:
   a. Create a new directory for project:
      $ mkdir sample-project
      $ cd sample-project

   b. Initialize a Git repository:
      $ git init

   c. Add a basic project:
      $ touch index.html

   d. Commit the initial project:
      $ git add .
      $ git commit -m "Initial commit"

   e. Create a new repository on GitHub called "sample-project".

   f. Link the local repository to the remote GitHub repository:
      $ git remote add origin https://github.com/username/sample-project.git

   g. Push the initial commit to GitHub:
      $ git push -u origin main

2. Feature Addition:
   - Create a new README.md file and add an introduction to the project.

   Steps:
   a. Create the README.md file:
      $ touch README.md

   b. Edit the README.md file and add the following content:
      # Sample Project
      This is a sample project to demonstrate Git and GitHub workflow.

   c. Add and commit the changes:
      $ git add README.md
      $ git commit -m "Added README.md with project intro"

3. Branch Management:
   - Create a new branch, push it to GitHub, and manage the feature.

   Steps:
   a. Create a new branch named "feature/update-readme":
      $ git checkout -b feature/update-readme

   b. Make the necessary changes to the README.md file (if additional edits are needed).

   c. Add and commit the changes:
      $ git add README.md
      $ git commit -m "Updated README.md with more project details"

   d. Push the new branch to GitHub:
      $ git push -u origin feature/update-readme

4. Merge Changes:
   - After the review, merge the feature branch into the main branch.

   Steps:
   a. Switch to the main branch:
      $ git checkout main

   b. Pull the latest changes from the remote main branch:
      $ git pull origin main

   c. Merge the feature branch into main:
      $ git merge feature/update-readme

   d. Push the merged changes to the remote repository:
      $ git push origin main

5. Branch Cleanup:
   - Delete the feature branch locally and remotely after the merge.

   Steps:
   a. Delete the branch locally:
      $ git branch -d feature/update-readme

   b. Delete the branch remotely:
      $ git push origin --delete feature/update-readme
